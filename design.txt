Samurai Warriors De-Rusted Design Docs
 - The game is a true roguelike
 - Originally was written entirely in a terminal (Command Line)
   - Going to be top-down 2D Graphical instead
 - We're going to develop this entirely ourselves.
 - We're also going to be making reusable plugins as much as possible

 Menu System - Plugin
  - Data Driven
   - Load in the Menu Structure from an Asset
  - Available as a Resource
  - Extensible Renderer?
  - Send Events on menu selection

 Tile Renderer - Plugin
  - Renders a tile & all things above it in order
  - Might not need to actually render, just "draw" to the map?

 Camera System - Plugin
  - Likely connected to the Tile Renderer?
  - By default, the camera won't need to move, so... simple!

 Movement System - Internal
  - Checks for Collisions
  - Checks for Fights

 Player Input Handler - Internal
  - Update Player Position based off of Input Handler data

  AI Handler - Internal
   - Update AI Positions based off of AI... stuff... (we'll get to that later)

  Fight/Attack - Internal
   - Compute Attack vs Defense & update Health state of all associated entities
   - If AI killed, send Exp event
   - If Player killed, send Game Over event

  Level Gen System - Internal
   - Generates Map layouts
   - Generates AI mobs

  Level Up System - Internal
   - Handles when player Levels up
